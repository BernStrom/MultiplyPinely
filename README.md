Multiply Pinely is an edutainment app designed to help kids practice their multiplication tables.

To begin practicing, users need to choose their desired multiplication table to practice and the max number of questions per practice round. Multiplication tables starts from 2-12 and number of questions starts from 5-20 max.

After setting their desired options, users can start the practice round by tapping on the "Start Game" button. For answering the questions, users can type in their answers into the input field to submit their answers. As for the "entertainment" side, users can collect trees and will be awarded +1 tree for each question they got right. If users got their answer wrong, no trees are awarded. Trees are accumulative only for the current practice round and will be reset back to 0 for every new round.

An example, the player selected a "*Table of 2*" and "*5*" for their desired number of questions. When the game starts, the player will have to go through 5 questions with a random range of "*1-12 x 2*". When the player answers "*14*" for the question "*7 x 2*", 1 tree will be awarded to the player. When all questions are answered, the practice round ends with the option for the player to reset the game and start a new round with new settings.

## App preview



## Trying it yourself

Multiply Pinely  is written using Xcode 13.2 and Swift 5.0. To try it out, you can clone this project and build it immediately by opening `Multiply Pinely .xcodeproj`.

As far as I know the app feature is complete, but there are likely to be errors all over the place at least to begin with â€“ if you hit any problems, either building or running the app, please let me know.

## Important notes on usage

Keep in mind that this app is simply a project designed and built for my own personal educational purposes only. The sole purpose for this app project was to gain practical experience in building an app in iOS with Swift & SwiftUI. The state of this app was never meant to be production-ready, published onto the App Store, or to be monetized in any way, shape, or form.

If you wish to do any of the above, you will have to make some changes to the app before submitting to the App Store for approval. Please keep in mind of any potential violation of third-party license, such as the usage of SF Symbols and/or Emoji of the app icon.
